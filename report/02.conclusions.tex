\section{Conclusions}

\subsection{Machines}
Almost all the experiments were launched on several identical machines running Debian 9 on an Intel i3-4130, 3.40GHz CPU. We (manually) parallelized our grid searches taking advantages of those twenty machines that we could access remotely through SSH.
 
\subsection{Agreement}
We agree to the disclosure and publication of my name, and of the results with preliminary and final ranking.
